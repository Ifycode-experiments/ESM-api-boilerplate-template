# node-mongo-esm-kit

The **node-mongo-esm-kit** is the ES Module (esm) boilerplate template, from the 3 boilerplate templates to be generated by the node-mongo-cli, for nodejs and/or mongoDB development. Here is the list of all 3 templates to choose from:
- ES module template
- Commonjs template
- Typescript (coming soon)

## Installation
Download the template locally unto your computer through the node-mongo-cli. The CLI is built to provide better experience, but you can also download it manually. In the case where you are having issues using the CLI, download this repo from github. Report issues in the issues tab of the node-mongo-cli repo.

The node-mongo starter kit helps to make mongoDB development in nodejs easier. Using the node-mongo starter kit has been made easier with the [node-mongo-cli](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-cli). While you can also choose to download/clone this starter kit directly from github, the cli let's you not only install your preferred starter kit template, but also allows you to add new model & controller files with content using simple commands. Opt for the [cli](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-cli) for better experience.

## How to use the starter kit
Development environment has been set up already i.e. connection to server & db, eslint and babel transpiler. For use locally, you need to have `mongoDB` [installed](https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/server/install/) with database and collection created and mongoDB running. If you choose to use `mongoDB atlas` then you don't need to have mongoDB installed - just turn on wifi/data connection, [create database and connect to your cluster](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/).

**Installation:**
* Install preferred starter kit template through cli or download from github.
* Cd into the folder you installed it and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
* Run `npm start` or `npm start -s` to start the server and mongoDB connection.
* There are two options - `installed MongoDB` option and `MongoDB ATLAS` option. To setup successful connection for whichever option you wish to use for your project, follow the guide written in yellow, which comes up after `Server running at http://localhost:3000` and `Error in DB connection` message in the console.

**Customizing dev environment:**

Replace `insert-your-project-name` with your own project name in `src > startMessage.js`.

## Contributing to the starter kit
