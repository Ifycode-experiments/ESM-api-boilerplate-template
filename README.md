The **node-mongo-esm-kit** is the ES Module (esm) boilerplate template, from the 3 boilerplate templates to be generated by the node-mongo-cli, for nodejs and/or mongoDB development. Here is the list of all 3 templates to choose from:
- [ES module template](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-esm-kit)
- [Commonjs template](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-cjs-kit)
- Typescript (coming soon)

## Installation
Download the template locally unto your computer through the node-mongo-cli. The CLI is built to provide better experience, but you can also clone or download it manually. In the case where you are having issues using the CLI, download this repo from github. Report issues in the issues tab of the node-mongo-cli repo.

Change directory (cd) into the root of the downloaded template and install dependencies:
````
npm install
````

Start server and mongoDB connection:
````
npm start
````
**Note:** Incase you see an error message in the terminal, the next sections will address how you can set up your mongoDB connection successfully.

## MongoDB connection options
There are two monogoDB connection options already setup for you to choose from:
1. Connection to MongoDB installed on your computer
2. Connection to MongoDB atlas

In the case where the error message `Error in DB connection` is displayed in the terminal when you start the server, you need to either install and get mongoDB running for use locally on your computer or setup mongoDB atlas. More notes on how to get the success message `Installed MongoDB connection successful!!!` or `MongoDB ATLAS connection successful!!!` to show up in the terminal in the sections that explain the mongoDB connection options individually. [Visit this link to install mongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/server/install/) on your computer and get mongoDB running if you haven't. [Or choose to use mongoDB atlas](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/) and connect to your cluster.

## Installed mongoDB option
Create a `.env` file in the root of the downloaded template. After installing mongoDB, keep mongoDB running in the terminal(s) as shown in the mongoDB docs. Create a database. Add the database name to the .env file like so:
````
DBNAME="insert-your-own-db-name-here"
````


 

<!--

Create a database



- 
- 
- Create a After creating your data
- Create a .env file


If you are using mongoDB installed on your computer, then

## MongoDB atlas option



Take note that the set up also involves these whether you choose the installed option or atlas: Setting up a database - you will need this for `db.js` and `.env` files, and use of the appropriate import in the `src/app.js` file. 

Take note that this also includes setting up a database and collection whether you choose the installed option or atlas. Once any of the connection options have been set up, you start the server and you use the appropriate import in the app.js file, the console message `Installed MongoDB connection successful!!!` should now show up in the terminal. More notes on this in the sections that explain the connection options individually.







The node-mongo starter kit helps to make mongoDB development in nodejs easier. Using the node-mongo starter kit has been made easier with the [node-mongo-cli](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-cli). While you can also choose to download/clone this starter kit directly from github, the cli let's you not only install your preferred starter kit template, but also allows you to add new model & controller files with content using simple commands. Opt for the [cli](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-cli) for better experience.

## How to use the starter kit
Development environment has been set up already i.e. connection to server & db, eslint and babel transpiler. For use locally, you need to have `mongoDB` [installed](https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/server/install/) with database and collection created and mongoDB running. If you choose to use `mongoDB atlas` then you don't need to have mongoDB installed - just turn on wifi/data connection, [create database and connect to your cluster](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/).

**Installation:**
* Install preferred starter kit template through cli or download from github.
* Cd into the folder you installed it and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
* Run `npm start` or `npm start -s` to start the server and mongoDB connection.
* There are two options - `installed MongoDB` option and `MongoDB ATLAS` option. To setup successful connection for whichever option you wish to use for your project, follow the guide written in yellow, which comes up after `Server running at http://localhost:3000` and `Error in DB connection` message in the console.

**Customizing dev environment:**

Replace `insert-your-project-name` with your own project name in `src > startMessage.js`.

## Contributing to the starter kit
See [contributor guide](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/docs/contributor-guide/contributor-guide) and [node-mongo project](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/docs/contributor-guide/node-mongo-project) portion of the documentation guide for how to contribute to the starter kit templates.
